## What is VaaS?
Visualization as a Service, or VaaS, is open source tooling that allows individuals or teams to visualize and monitor their Kubernetes clusters in real-time. VaaS takes monitoring and visualization one step further by offering users a tech-agnostic solution for incorporating serverless functions into their clusters via OpenFaaS functionality. It serves to eventually be a one-stop shop for all of your Kubernetes monitoring and visualization needs, while giving you the power to deploy functions to your cluster with ease.

VaaS was developed with the support of OSLabs and the OpenFaaS community. It is actively in the process of being developed and is not quite yet ready for production use. However, we are always looking for contributors and feedback, so feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns.

## Current Features
- Monitoring of key metrics of multiple clusters from a centralized dashboard
- Graphical visualization of your cluster, including all pods, services, and deployments, as well as their current status, powered by KubeView
- In-depth graphical visualization of key cluster metrics, powered by Grafana
  - Several pre-built dashboards consisting of key metrics are available for ease of use
- Execution of custom queries on your cluster via the Prometheus API
- Deployment, invocation, and deletion of serverless function via OpenFaaS
  - Assess the potential cost of your function via the OpenFaaS API
- Management of cluster settings to account for any changes in your cluster

## Getting Started
If you are interested in trying out VaaS, please check out our [SETUP](/SETUP.md) guide for instructions on how to get started with a small Minikube cluster. 

These instructions should also be highly relevant to anyone attempting to deploy such a cluster to a cloud provider.
